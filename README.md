A pretty simple game. I just made this to practice a bit with OCaml.
See the rules [on
Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tic-tac-toe). Right
now, it's just a simple minimax algorithm that's pretty easy to beat.

If you want to play against a human (or, for that matter, a really
unintelligent random-moving AI), you can change the functor argument
in `tictactoe.ml`.
